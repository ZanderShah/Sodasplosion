This is a bomberman clone written in Java for ICS3U6 at Richmond Hill High School.

We tried to add AI at first so that you could play on single player but we ran out of time so currently, the AI avoids explosions and places explosives when it is not in danger. 
There is no movement code so the AI teleports to the target location.
